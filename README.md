This is my playground for exploring the world of Machine Learning

A handful of algorithms implemented in Python. They all contain documentation what they do. To run them, use the following commands:

```bash
uv run naive_bayes_classifier.py
```

```bash
uv run flight_optimizer.py
```

```bash
uv run recommendations.py
```

```bash
uv run genetic_programming.py
```
